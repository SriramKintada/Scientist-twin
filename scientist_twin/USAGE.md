# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Run the App

```bash
cd scientist_twin
python main.py
```

## What to Expect

### Step 1: Domain Selection
Choose from:
1. The Cosmos (Astronomy, Space)
2. Life & Biology (Medicine, Genetics)
3. Quantum Logic (Physics, Math, CS)
4. Earth & Environment (Geology, Climate)
5. Engineering Feats (Technology, Innovation)

### Step 2: Impact Style
Choose from:
1. Theoretical Discovery
2. Societal Change
3. Engineering Feats
4. Education & Mentorship

### Step 3: Personality Quiz
Answer 6 tailored scenario questions. Each question has 4 options that map to different personality traits:
- Persistence
- Risk-Taking
- Intuition
- Logic
- Collaboration
- Social Impact
- Resilience
- Creativity

### Step 4: Results
You'll receive:

1. **Primary Match**: Your scientific twin with:
   - Match quality (Deep Resonance / Parallel Paths / Kindred Spirits)
   - 2-3 resonances (what you share)
   - 1-2 contrasts (where you differ)
   - Working style summary
   - Character moment from their life

2. **Alternative Matches**: 2 more scientists who match you

3. **Technical Transparency**: Your full trait breakdown

## Example Session

```
Welcome to Scientist Twin 2.0
-> Select Domain: 3 (Quantum Logic)
-> Select Impact: 1 (Theoretical Discovery)
-> Answer 6 questions...
-> Finding your scientific twin...

Result: Srinivasa Ramanujan - Deep Resonance
  Resonances: Intuition, Persistence, Creativity
  Contrasts: You're collaborative, Ramanujan worked solo
  ...
```

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be honest**: There are no wrong answers
2. **Think scenarios**: Imagine yourself in each situation
3. **Read carefully**: Each option emphasizes different traits
4. **Explore alternatives**: All 3 matches offer interesting insights

## Database Coverage

Current database: 12 legendary Indian scientists across:
- **Physics**: C.V. Raman, Bhabha, Chandrasekhar, J.C. Bose
- **Mathematics**: Ramanujan
- **Space/Engineering**: Kalam, Sarabhai, Tessy Thomas
- **Biology**: Salim Ali, Khorana, Subbarow, Swaminathan

## Troubleshooting

**"API Error"**: Check your Gemini API key in `config.py`

**"Wikipedia Error"**: Some scientists may have network issues - the app will use fallback data

**"No matches found"**: Try selecting a different domain or impact style

## What Makes a Good Match?

This app uses **interpretive AI matching**, not rigid algorithms:
- We compare your trait profile to biographical narratives
- AI finds meaningful parallels in working styles and life choices
- The "match quality" is qualitative, not a percentage

Remember: This is a creative exploration tool designed to help you discover Indian scientific heritage through a personalized lens.
